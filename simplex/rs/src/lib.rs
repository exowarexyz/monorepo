//! Store-backed Simplex upload client.
//!
//! `exoware-simplex` stores Commonware Simplex artifacts in the Exoware Store
//! using a stable logical key layout. It is intentionally a client library, not
//! a consensus participant: callers still build and verify Commonware blocks and
//! certificates, then use this crate to persist the encoded artifacts.
