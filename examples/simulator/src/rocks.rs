//! Naive reference storage for local development: user keys and values are written as-is to
//! RocksDB. A `meta` column family holds the state-floor row, and a `log` column family keeps
//! one row per commit group: the exact `log.stream.v1.GetResponse` bytes the stream service
//! serves for that sequence, loaded on demand. Everything is addressed by key: recovery and
//! pruning never assume which SST files rows live in, so RocksDB is free to place and compact
//! them however it likes.
//!
//! Writes bypass the WAL and the memtables: `prepare` coalesces queued requests into commit
//! groups that each share one sequence number and queues them for a pool of stage workers,
//! which build each group's log row and sorted state rows as two SST files (concurrently
//! across groups), while `commit` reorders staged groups back into sequence order and ingests
//! each: the log file first (the durable row alone defines the group; `open` derives the
//! frontier from the highest retained row and the state-floor meta row), then the state file,
//! then publish and ack. Several groups can be queued, staging, or buffered awaiting their
//! predecessors at once (the queue and worker count bound staged memory), but ingestion stays
//! atomic and strictly ordered, so a crash never leaves a partial batch and at most the
//! newest ingested group can be missing its state ingestion; `open` repairs that by
//! re-applying the newest retained log row (idempotent: its rows are the newest writes for
//! their keys). The floor meta row is written only by pruning and is durable by the time a
//! prune acks: it marks state the replay must never touch (re-applying key-pruned rows would
//! resurrect them) and keeps a fully-pruned log from regressing the frontier.
//!
//! Any write failure in the pipeline is fatal: once a group's log row is durable it cannot be
//! rolled back (its sequence number must never be re-issued), so the writer panics and the next
//! open rolls the store forward instead of any in-process recovery.
