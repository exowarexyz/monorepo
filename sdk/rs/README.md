Interact with the Exoware API in Rust.

`StoreClient` supports HTTP and HTTPS endpoints. HTTPS connections verify certificates using the
platform trust configuration.

## Status

`exoware-sdk` is **ALPHA** software and is not yet recommended for production use. Developers should expect breaking changes and occasional instability.

## Store Key Prefixes

Use `StoreKeyPrefix` when multiple logical QMDB, SQL, or raw KV instances share one Store database. The prefix is applied by the SDK, so higher-level clients keep using their normal logical keys:

```rust
use exoware_sdk::{StoreClient, StoreKeyPrefix};

let base = StoreClient::new("http://localhost:10000");
let orders = base.prefixed(StoreKeyPrefix::new(vec![1])?);
let accounts = base.prefixed(StoreKeyPrefix::new(vec![2])?);
```

For an atomic write spanning multiple prefixed clients, add each logical row through the client that owns it and commit once:

```rust
use exoware_sdk::StoreWriteBatch;

let mut batch = StoreWriteBatch::new();
batch.push(&orders, &order_key, order_value)?;
batch.push(&accounts, &account_key, account_value)?;
let sequence = batch.commit(&base).await?;
```

## Examples

`remote` writes a batch to a deployed endpoint and reads it back, pinning each read to the sequence it just committed:

```bash
EXOWARE_URL=https://query.<deployment>.<domain> \
    EXOWARE_API_KEY=<token> \
    cargo run -p exoware-sdk --example remote
```

`EXOWARE_API_KEY` is the credential a public deployment requires, and the builder reads it from
the environment when `.api_key(...)` is not set. This example needs one covering both scopes.

Add `EXOWARE_WRITE_URL` to reach a deployment that serves its write path on a separate origin.

## RPC Transports

High-throughput writers can opt into independent HTTP clients per RPC origin.

```rust
use std::num::NonZeroUsize;
use exoware_sdk::{BalancedHttp2Config, StoreClient};

let client = StoreClient::builder()
    .url("http://localhost:10000")
    .balanced_http2_transport(
        BalancedHttp2Config::default()
            .with_connections_per_origin(NonZeroUsize::new(4).unwrap()),
    )
    .build()?;
```

HTTP uses prior-knowledge h2c. HTTPS requires HTTP/2 through ALPN and uses platform trust by
default. `with_tls_config` accepts custom roots and client certificates but replaces configured
ALPN protocols with HTTP/2. Open streams use HTTP/2 PINGs to detect dead peers. The request timeout
bounds complete unary calls and streaming response headers without stopping a streaming body.

`StoreClientBuilder::client_transport` accepts types re-exported under `exoware_sdk::transport`.
The SDK still owns authentication, cookies, and compression preferences. Tower services can use
`ServiceTransport`. A `tower::BoxError` must first be mapped into a concrete `std::error::Error`.
